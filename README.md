# Personal-Healthcare-Program-with-LineBot
A final-team-project of Introduction of Programing. We created a program that can record user's daily diet, exercise time, water intake, and sleeping time. Then we gave back suggestions on how to live a healthier life. We used LineBot to present our program, and were invited by the professor to share what we've done with the whole class.
